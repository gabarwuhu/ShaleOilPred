# ShaleOilPred
Code for shale oil production prediction using machine learning
## Features
- Uses **Random Forest** and Bayesian optimization for model tuning.
- Implements **K-Fold Cross-Validation** to improve generalization.
- Utilizes **Numba JIT compilation** to speed up numerical computations.
- Supports **Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** evaluation metrics.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python 3.12 installed. You can install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn scikit-optimize numba
```

## Usage
Run the main script to perform shale oil production prediction:

```bash
VA-RF.py
```

Modify hyperparameters or adjust K-Fold settings in the script as needed.

## Dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `scikit-optimize`
- `numba`
